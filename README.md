# Justin Verlander Pitch Performance Analysis

In our project, we conducted a detailed analysis of pitching performance in baseball, with a specific focus on the renowned pitcher Justin Verlander. 
Questions we wanted to answer:

#### Pitching Performance and Patterns by Team: 
Does Justin Verlander's pitching performance and pitching patterns change when he transitions between different teams, each potentially having different pitching coaches?

#### Effectiveness of Pitch Types: 
Among Verlander's four main pitch types (4-seam fastball, curveball, change-up, and slider), which pitch type yields the best results in terms of getting outs?

#### Impact of Pitching Variables: 
How do various pitching variables affect the outcome when a batter is at the plate? This involves exploring how factors like pitch type, speed, and movement influence the results of a plate appearance.

#### Modeling and Prediction: 
Can linear and logistic models be constructed to predict the outcome given specific pitching variables and to predict the likelihood of a batter being called out?

#### Coaching and Performance: 
How can the insights gained from this analysis benefit Verlander's coaching staff? Specifically, can this analysis help coaches understand his pitching performance, identify the most effective pitches, gauge improvement over time, and evaluate the influence of pitching coaches on a player's performance?

#### Recognition and Compensation for Coaches: 
Will the findings highlight the significant impact of pitching coaches on a player's performance, potentially leading to increased recognition and compensation for coaching staff?

### Verlander_Detroit_Fixed.csv and Verlander_Houston_Fixed.csv are the data sets used and they contain pitching metrics from nearly every single one of Justin Verlander's pitches in his baseball career including mph, direction, pitch type, lauch angle, exit velocity, distance, etc.
### DATA367_ProjectCodeV.3.Rmd contains all the code used for this project along with in depth analysis.
### Final Presentation.pdf is the final powerpoint presentation for this project with more analysis.
